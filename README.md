# Term Deposit Conversion Rate Prediction & Analysis : Project Overview
- Build a _machine learning_ model to predict client that subscribe term deposit
- Dataset is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets/code
- Preprocessing the data from 'unknown' value with mode() for job, education, and contact features
- Handle data outliers with Z-score  
- Transform the data with StandardScaler()
- Engineered features to optimizing the learning process of model
- Split the data into train and test 70:30
- train the model with 5 different algorithms with hyperparameter tuning and choose the best algorithm 
- Handle imbalance class with Threshold Moving 
- Validate the model with data test
